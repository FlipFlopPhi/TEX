When we designed our implementation, we had to create a set of rules/criteria to which the program has to adhere.
\begin{itemize}
\item An element generated from a website, should create a website similar, if not identical, to its original.
\item If two websites are the exact same, the distance between them has to be 0.
\item The distance between an unpadded element and its padded version has to be 0. As long as this rule is not violated, then the padding will not alter elements.
\end{itemize}
To implement our solution we've used Java, although other programming languages could also have been used.
