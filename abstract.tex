The rapidly increasing size of the internet demands an automated solution for retrieving data about websites. While we are already able to analyze websites on their contents, an automated solution for analyzing and comparing web page layouts does not yet exist.\\
Thus we have designed a program that translates web page layouts into data trees, and uses those to calculate the tree edit distance between them, so that we are able to do layout-analysis.
