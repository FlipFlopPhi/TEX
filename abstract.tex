The rapidly increasing size of the internet demands an automated solution for retrieving data about websites. While we are already able to analyze websites on their contents, an automated solution for analyzing and comparing layouts does not yet exist.\\
Thus we've designed a program that translates website layouts into data trees, and uses those to calculate the edit-tree-distance between them, so that we are able to do layout-analysis.
