\chapter{Discusion}\label{Discusion}
Our current implementation is able to create an objective representation of the websites we're using. 
We have shown that it is possible to retrieve information from a website, while only looking at the layout. However our current implementation is very crude and could definitely be improved on certain aspects.\\

\section{Evaluation}
During the development-process, we have left out three websites: Twitter.com, Reddit.com and Tumblr.com. These were left out because they were to big to be handled by our software. However if the html-parser were to be made more efficient, then these websites would also be able to be parsed.\\
Our current parser, also doesn't handle every css-attribute, however the current parser is able to retrieve them, thus a future version would be able to handle these. This means that while our solution is incomplete, it is still a valid proof of concept, since it still shows us that there is information inside the websites layout.
